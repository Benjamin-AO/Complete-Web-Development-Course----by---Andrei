General there are no right or wrong layout method to use. CSS grid and flexbox are complimentary to each other.

Basic Rule of Thumb

Flexbox is good to be used if you have one dimensional item. eg. when your layout is basicaly columns
CSS grids are powerfull when it comes to 2 dimensional layout. eg. when your layout has both columns and rows, such as image galleries or listing out your portfolio projects on your webpage.
